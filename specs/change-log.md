# Change Log — Titra

## 2026-05-26 (90) — Phase 3: Settlements module

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/settlements/dto/create-settlement.dto.ts` (**new**): `CreateSettlementDto` — required `fromMemberId`, `toMemberId` (non-empty strings), `amount` (integer ≥ 1); optional `method` (`SettlementMethod` enum, defaults to CASH) and `proofUrl` (`@IsUrl`).
- `apps/api/src/settlements/settlements.service.ts` (**new**): `SettlementsService` with four methods:
  - `createSettlement`: verifies event is not SETTLED/ARCHIVED; caller must be ACTIVE member; from ≠ to; both `fromMemberId`/`toMemberId` must belong to the event; creates `Settlement` with `status: PENDING`.
  - `getSettlements`: verifies event exists; caller must be ACTIVE member; returns all settlements ordered by `createdAt DESC` with `fromMember` and `toMember` included.
  - `confirmSettlement`: verifies event exists; caller must be ACTIVE member; settlement must be PENDING; only the recipient (`toMember.userId`) or ORGANIZER may confirm; sets `status: CONFIRMED` and `confirmedAt`.
  - `deleteSettlement`: verifies event exists; caller must be ACTIVE member; settlement must be PENDING (CONFIRMED cannot be deleted); only the payer (`fromMember.userId`) or ORGANIZER may delete.
- `apps/api/src/settlements/settlements.controller.ts` (**new**): `SettlementsController` at `events/:eventId/settlements` — `POST` → 201, `GET` → 200, `PATCH :settlementId/confirm` → 200, `DELETE :settlementId` → 204.
- `apps/api/src/settlements/settlements.module.ts` (**new**): NestJS module wiring controller + service.
- `apps/api/src/settlements/payment-deeplinks.ts` (**new**): two pure utility functions:
  - `generateMomoDeepLink({ phone, amount, note })` → `{ deepLink, webUrl }`. Deep-link uses `momo://transfer`; web fallback uses `nhantien.momo.vn`.
  - `generateVNPayDeepLink({ bankAccount, amount, description })` → `{ deepLink, webUrl }`. Deep-link uses `vnpay://transfer`; web fallback uses `vnpay.vn/transfer`.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: registered `SettlementsModule`.

## 2026-05-25 (89) — Phase 3: Cloudinary upload service (receipt photos)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/upload/cloudinary.service.ts` (**new**): `CloudinaryService` — configured via `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME/API_KEY/API_SECRET`; gracefully degrades to mock responses when env vars are absent (dev/test). Methods: `generateSignedUploadParams(folder)` returns signed params for direct browser→Cloudinary uploads (files never pass through NestJS); `uploadBuffer(buffer, folder)` for server-side uploads (used by future export module); `deleteFile(publicId)` for cleanup.
- `apps/api/src/upload/upload.controller.ts` (**new**): `GET /api/v1/upload/sign?folder=receipts` → 200 with `{ signature, timestamp, apiKey, cloudName, folder }`. Defaults to `folder=receipts` if omitted.
- `apps/api/src/upload/upload.module.ts` (**new**): exports `CloudinaryService` so it can be injected by future modules (export, etc.).
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: registered `UploadModule`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (88) — Phase 3: Expenses module — Balance calculation service unit tests

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/balance.service.spec.ts` (**new**): 14 unit tests covering `simplifyDebts()` and `BalanceService.compute()` — no DB mocking needed (pure functions). Cases: empty input, all-zero nets, creditor-only/debtor-only (no settlements), exact 1-to-1 match, partial creditor match, classic 3-way equal split, 3-debtor-2-creditor minimisation, members with net = 0 excluded, large VND integers, nickname propagation; plus 3 `BalanceService` wrapper tests.

---

## 2026-05-25 (87) — Phase 3: Expenses module — GET /events/:id/balances (debt simplification)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/balance.service.ts` (**new**): `BalanceService.compute()` wraps the pure `simplifyDebts()` function. Algorithm: sort creditors (net > 0) and debtors (net < 0) by absolute value, greedily match largest pairs, emitting one `SettlementSuggestion` per pairing until all balances reach zero — O(n log n), minimum number of transactions.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/balances.controller.ts` (**new**): `GET /events/:eventId/balances` → 200. Loads all ACTIVE members with their paid-expense totals and split totals via a single Prisma query, computes `net = totalPaid − totalOwed` per member, delegates to `BalanceService.compute()`. Returns `{ members: [...], settlements: [...] }`.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.module.ts`: registered `BalancesController` and `BalanceService`; exports `BalanceService` for upcoming unit-test task.

---

## 2026-05-25 (86) — Phase 3: Expenses module — DELETE /events/:id/expenses/:expenseId (soft delete)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.service.ts`: added `deleteExpense()` — blocks deletion on SETTLED/ARCHIVED events; guards: caller must be the `paidBy` member (creator) or ORGANIZER; sets `deletedAt = now()` (soft delete — splits are preserved in DB for balance history).
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.controller.ts`: added `DELETE /events/:eventId/expenses/:expenseId` → 204 No Content.

---

## 2026-05-25 (85) — Phase 3: Expenses module — PATCH /events/:id/expenses/:expenseId (edit expense)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/dto/update-expense.dto.ts` (**new**): all fields optional; `@ValidateIf` keeps `splits` required only when `splitType` is being set to `CUSTOM`.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.service.ts`: added `updateExpense()` — blocks edits on SETTLED/ARCHIVED events; guards: caller must be `paidBy` member (creator) or ORGANIZER; if any split-related field changes (`amount`, `splitType`, `memberIds`, `splits`), deletes old splits and creates new ones atomically in a transaction; falls back to existing split data when partial info is supplied (e.g. only `amount` changes on a CUSTOM expense reuses stored splits).
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.controller.ts`: added `PATCH /events/:eventId/expenses/:expenseId` → 200.

---

## 2026-05-25 (84) — Phase 3: Expenses module — GET /events/:id/expenses (list non-deleted expenses)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.service.ts`: added `getExpenses()` — verifies caller is an ACTIVE member of the event, then returns all non-deleted expenses ordered by `createdAt DESC`, each including `paidBy` member info and `splits` with member nickname/userId.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.controller.ts`: added `GET /events/:eventId/expenses` → 200.

---

## 2026-05-25 (83) — Phase 3: Expenses module — POST /events/:id/expenses (create expense + splits)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/expenses/dto/create-expense.dto.ts` (**new**): `CreateExpenseDto` with `SplitItemDto` nested class. Validates `splitType` (EQUAL/CUSTOM), `paidById`, `amount` (integer ≥ 1), `description` (max 200), optional `category`, `receiptUrl`. For EQUAL mode accepts optional `memberIds` array; for CUSTOM mode requires `splits` array via `@ValidateIf`.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.service.ts` (**new**): `ExpensesService.createExpense()` — validates caller is ACTIVE member, validates `paidById` is an ACTIVE member, computes splits (EQUAL with remainder to first member per spec, CUSTOM with sum-check), creates expense + splits in a single Prisma transaction, returns full expense with paidBy and splits included.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.controller.ts` (**new**): `POST /events/:eventId/expenses` → 201.
- `apps/api/src/expenses/expenses.module.ts` (**new**): NestJS module wiring controller + service.
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: registered `ExpensesModule`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (82) — Phase 3: Events module — integration tests for all Events endpoints (M2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/test/events.e2e-spec.ts` (**new**): 43 integration tests against the live Neon DB via Supertest, following the same isolation strategy as `auth.e2e-spec.ts` (per-run `e2e-<timestamp>-` prefix; cleanup order: events before users due to `onDelete: Restrict` on `organizerId`).
  - `POST /events`: 201 happy path (with optional fields), 401, 400 missing/empty name
  - `GET /events`: returns only the caller's events, excludes soft-deleted events, 401
  - `GET /events/:id`: 200 for member, 403 for non-member, 404, 401
  - `PATCH /events/:id`: 200 organizer update, 403 non-organizer, 404, 401
  - `DELETE /events/:id`: 204 soft-delete (verifies `deletedAt` set in DB), 403, 404, 401
  - `GET /events/:id/invite`: 200 organizer, 403 non-organizer member, 401
  - `POST /events/:id/join`: 201 happy path, 409 already member, 400 wrong token, 400 ARCHIVED (status set directly via DB to avoid 404 from soft-delete), 401
  - `POST /events/:id/members`: 201 guest by name, guest `inviteToken` is null in response, 200 enumeration-safe for missing email, 201 creates PENDING member for verified user (verifies DB row), 409 already active, 403, 400 neither field, 401
  - `DELETE /events/:id/members/:memberId`: 204 soft-delete (verifies `removedAt` in DB), 400 target is ORGANIZER, 403, 404, 401

---

## 2026-05-25 (81) — Phase 3: Events module — unit tests for EventsService (M1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.spec.ts` (**new**): 44 unit tests covering all public methods of `EventsService` with a mocked `PrismaService`. Tests follow the same `jest.fn()` + `mockPrisma` pattern established in `auth.service.spec.ts`.
  - `createEvent`: happy path (transaction creates event + organizer member), 404 when user doesn't exist
  - `getEvents`: returns correct query shape (filters by membership + `deletedAt: null`)
  - `getEventDetail`: happy path, 404 event not found, 403 caller not a member
  - `updateEvent`: happy path, 404, 403 non-organizer
  - `deleteEvent`: soft-delete (sets `deletedAt` + `status: ARCHIVED`), 404, 403
  - `joinEvent`: creates new member, restores removed member, 404/400 ARCHIVED/400 SETTLED/400 bad token/409 already active
  - `removeMember`: soft-delete, 404 event, 403 non-organizer, 400 SETTLED, 400 ARCHIVED, 404 member not found, 400 target is ORGANIZER
  - `addMember` (email): PENDING member created, invite token stripped from response, enumeration-safe 200 for missing/inactive/unverified users, 409 already active, 403, 400 ARCHIVED/SETTLED
  - `addMember` (guest): creates row with `userId: null`, 400 when neither email nor name provided
  - `acceptInvitation`: activates + clears token, 404 bad token, 403 wrong user, 409 already active, 400 expired, 400 event deleted, 400 SETTLED, 400 ARCHIVED

## 2026-05-25 (80) — Phase 3: Events missing feature — restrict GET /events/:id/invite to organizer (M5)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `getInvite`: replaced the membership check (`members: { where: { userId } }`) with an organizer check (`event.organizerId !== userId → 403`). The select now fetches `organizerId` instead of the members array. Non-organizer members calling `GET /events/:id/invite` now receive `403 Chỉ ban tổ chức mới có thể xem link mời`. Regular members can still join via the link after the organizer shares it out-of-band; they don't need API access to the token itself.

---

## 2026-05-25 (79) — Phase 3: Events missing feature — FK from Event.organizerId → User (M4)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - `Event` model: added `organizer User @relation(fields: [organizerId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)`. `Restrict` prevents deleting a user who is the organizer of any event — the admin must archive/transfer the event first. Previously `organizerId` was a bare `String` with no DB-level enforcement, so deleting a user could silently orphan all their events.
  - `User` model: added `organizedEvents Event[]` (the inverse side of the relation, required by Prisma).
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260525_add_event_organizer_fk/migration.sql` (**new**): `ALTER TABLE "events" ADD CONSTRAINT "events_organizerId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("organizerId") REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE`. Applied via `db push` (Neon pooler blocks shadow-DB creation) then recorded with `prisma migrate resolve --applied`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (78) — Phase 3: Events missing feature — PATCH /events/:id/invite regenerates public invite token (M3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - Added `regenerateInviteToken(eventId, userId)`: verifies the caller is the organizer, then replaces `event.inviteToken` with a fresh `randomUUID()`. Returns `{ inviteToken, inviteUrl }` in the same shape as `getInvite`. The old token is immediately invalidated — any existing `/join/:oldToken` links stop working as soon as the DB is updated.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`:
  - Added `PATCH /events/:id/invite` → `regenerateInviteToken`. No request body needed.

---

## 2026-05-25 (77) — Phase 3: Events module security fix — addMember per-target invite rate limit (S3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): added `joinedAt` to the `existing` member select. Before re-sending an invite to a PENDING member, checks whether `joinedAt` is within the last hour; if so, returns `{ ok: true }` silently instead of generating a new token and sending another email. The silent response preserves enumeration-safety — an organizer cannot distinguish "rate-limited" from "email not found" by inspecting the response. The 1-hour window is tracked via the existing `joinedAt` field (updated on every re-invite) so no schema change is needed.

---

## 2026-05-25 (76) — Phase 3: Events module security fix — addMember strips invite token from response (S2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): destructures `inviteToken` and `inviteTokenExpiry` out of the Prisma result before returning, so neither field appears in the `201` response body. The token is only transmitted via the email sent to the invitee — exposing it in the API response would allow the organizer to accept the invite on behalf of the invitee or construct the acceptance URL without the invitee's involvement.

---

## 2026-05-25 (75) — Phase 3: Events module security fix — addMember fully enumeration-safe (S1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): merged three separate early-return/throw branches into one: `if (!target || !target.isActive || !target.emailVerified) return { ok: true }`. Previously, a non-existent email returned `{ ok: true }` (correct) but a deactivated or unverified account threw a distinct `400` with a descriptive message — an attacker could probe any email address to learn whether it has an account and what its state is. All three cases now return the same silent `{ ok: true }` response, matching the pattern used in `forgotPassword`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (74) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — addMember guest path blocks duplicate nicknames (M5)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (guest path): before creating the `EventMember` row, now queries for an existing active guest (`userId: null`) with the same `nickname` in the same event. Throws `409 Conflict` if found. The check filters `removedAt: null` so a previously removed guest with the same name can be re-added without conflict. Previously two rows with identical nicknames could be created, making their financial histories impossible to reconcile in the balance calculation.

---

## 2026-05-25 (73) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — removeMember blocks SETTLED/ARCHIVED events (M4)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `removeMember`: expanded the `findFirst` select to include `status`, then added a guard that throws `400` when `event.status` is `SETTLED` or `ARCHIVED`. Previously, the organizer could soft-delete a member from a settled event, which would silently corrupt the historical balance — the removed member's past expenses would still exist but their membership would be gone, making the debt ledger inconsistent on re-calculation.

---

## 2026-05-25 (72) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — unify invite URL format and add frontend pages (F5)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `sendEventInviteEmail`: changed email link URL from `/invitations/accept?token=${token}` to `/invitations/${token}/accept` — aligns with the new `POST /invitations/:token/accept` REST route (path param, not query param), matching the NestJS controller convention used throughout the codebase.
  - Added `resolveEventByInviteToken(token)` — public method that looks up an event by its `inviteToken` and returns the preview fields (`id`, `name`, `type`, `description`, `status`). Used by the join page before the user authenticates.
  - Added `joinByEventToken(token, userId)` — resolves the eventId from the event-level invite token, then delegates to the existing `joinEvent` method.
  - Added `acceptInvitationByMemberToken(token, userId)` — resolves the eventId from the member-level `inviteToken` on `EventMember`, then delegates to the existing `acceptInvitation` method.
- `apps/api/src/events/join.controller.ts` (**new**): `@Controller('join')` — `GET /:token` (public, event preview), `POST /:token` (authenticated, join event).
- `apps/api/src/events/invitations.controller.ts` (**new**): `@Controller('invitations')` — `POST /:token/accept` (authenticated, accept email invite).
- `apps/api/src/events/events.module.ts`: registered `JoinController` and `InvitationsController`.
- `apps/web/app/join/[token]/page.tsx` (**new**): public join page — shows event name/type/description and a "Tham gia sự kiện" CTA that routes through login with a redirect back to the join URL.
- `apps/web/app/invitations/[token]/accept/page.tsx` (**new**): invitation acceptance page — shows event name and an "Chấp nhận lời mời" button (wired to `POST /invitations/:token/accept` in Phase 4).

---

## 2026-05-25 (71) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — EVENT_LIST_SELECT counts only active non-removed members (F4)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `EVENT_LIST_SELECT`: replaced `_count: { select: { members: true } }` with `_count: { select: { members: { where: { status: MemberStatus.ACTIVE, removedAt: null } } } }`. Previously the count included PENDING members (invited but not yet accepted) and soft-deleted members (removedAt not null), so the dashboard card would show an inflated member count. Now only members who are fully active and not removed are counted, matching the visible membership shown in the event detail view.

---

## 2026-05-25 (70) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — acceptInvitation guards deleted and terminal-status events (F3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `acceptInvitation`: expanded the `findFirst` select to include `event: { select: { deletedAt, status } }` so the parent event is fetched in a single query. Added two guards before the ownership check: (1) throws `400` if `event.deletedAt !== null` — prevents activating a member on a soft-deleted event; (2) throws `400` if `event.status` is `SETTLED` or `ARCHIVED` — prevents accepting an invitation to a terminal-state event. Previously a user could accept an email invite after the event had been deleted or settled, creating an active membership that would never appear in any query (deleted events are filtered out of all list/detail views) or that would corrupt settled balances.

---

## 2026-05-25 (69) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — addMember blocks SETTLED events (F2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember`: expanded the status guard from `ARCHIVED`-only to `ARCHIVED || SETTLED`. Error message updated to the generic "Không thể thêm thành viên vào sự kiện đã kết thúc" (covers both terminal states). Previously, the organizer could add members (email or guest path) to a SETTLED event, which would introduce new participants after balances had already been calculated and confirmed, corrupting the debt ledger. The fix mirrors the same guard already applied in `joinEvent` (entry 66).

---

## 2026-05-25 (68) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — joinEvent restores member with status ACTIVE (F1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `joinEvent` (restore path): added `status: MemberStatus.ACTIVE`, `inviteToken: null`, `inviteTokenExpiry: null` to the `update` data when restoring a previously removed member. Previously only `removedAt` and `joinedAt` were reset, leaving the member in `PENDING` status if they had been invited via email before being removed. A PENDING member is filtered out by `getEvents`, `getEventDetail`, and `getInvite`, effectively locking them out of the event despite holding a valid session. Clearing the invite token fields also invalidates any stale email invitation after a public-link rejoin.

---

## 2026-05-25 (67) — Phase 3: Events module security fix — addMember enumeration-safe for unknown email (S3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): replaced `throw new NotFoundException(…)` when `target` is null with a silent `return { ok: true }`. The caller (organizer) receives a 201 response in both cases — found-and-invited and not-found — so the HTTP status code cannot be used to enumerate which emails have registered accounts. Pattern matches `forgotPassword()` which already uses the same enumeration-safe approach.

---

## 2026-05-25 (66) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — joinEvent blocks SETTLED events (F4)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `joinEvent`: expanded the status guard from `ARCHIVED`-only to `ARCHIVED || SETTLED`. Error message updated to the generic "Sự kiện đã kết thúc, không thể tham gia" (covers both terminal states). Previously a user could join a fully-settled event via invite link, which would corrupt balances by introducing a new member with zero history after settlement was calculated.

---

## 2026-05-25 (65) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — addMember validates isActive & emailVerified (F3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): expanded `user.findUnique` select to include `isActive` and `emailVerified`; throws `400 BadRequestException` ("Tài khoản người dùng này đã bị vô hiệu hoá") if `isActive` is false; throws `400 BadRequestException` ("Người dùng này chưa xác minh email…") if `emailVerified` is false. Both checks run after the 404 guard and before the existing-membership check, so deactivated/unverified users cannot be added even via re-invite.

---

## 2026-05-25 (64) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — addMember invite accept flow (F5)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` — thêm enum `MemberStatus { PENDING ACTIVE }` và 3 field vào `EventMember`: `status MemberStatus @default(ACTIVE)`, `inviteToken String? @unique`, `inviteTokenExpiry DateTime?`
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260525_add_member_status_and_invite_token/migration.sql` — tạo enum + alter table + unique index
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `addMember` (email path): tạo member với `status: PENDING` + generate `inviteToken` (UUID) và `inviteTokenExpiry` (48h); email chứa link accept thay vì link event trực tiếp; re-invite member bị remove hoặc PENDING cũng reset token
  - `acceptInvitation`: method mới — tìm member theo `inviteToken`, kiểm tra ownership + expiry, cập nhật `status → ACTIVE`, xóa token
  - `getEvents`: filter `status: ACTIVE` khi kiểm tra membership → PENDING member không thấy event trong dashboard
  - `getEventDetail`: filter `status: ACTIVE` trong danh sách member + access check
  - `getInvite`: filter `status: ACTIVE`
  - `joinEvent`: filter `status: ACTIVE` khi check existing membership
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts` — thêm `POST /events/:id/invitations/:token/accept`

---

## 2026-05-25 (63) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — addMember invite email (F2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - Added `escapeHtml` helper and `Logger` (matching auth service pattern)
  - `addMember` (email path): expanded event query to also fetch `name` and `inviteToken`; fetched organizer name in parallel via `Promise.all`; after creating/restoring the EventMember, fires `sendEventInviteEmail` as a non-blocking background call (`void`)
  - Added `sendEventInviteEmail` private method: sends an HTML email via Resend notifying the user which organizer added them and linking to the event; falls back to `logger.log` in dev when `RESEND_API_KEY` is absent

---

## 2026-05-25 (62) — Phase 3: Events module QA fix — removeMember soft-delete (F1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` — added `removedAt DateTime?` field to `EventMember`
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260525_add_removed_at_to_event_members/migration.sql` — new migration
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`:
  - `removeMember`: removed 409 financial-history block; now soft-deletes by setting `removedAt = now()` instead of hard-deleting — preserves all expense/settlement history per spec §5.2
  - `getEventDetail`: member list filtered to `removedAt: null`; active-membership check via join query updated accordingly
  - `joinEvent`: active-membership check filters `removedAt: null`; removed members who rejoin via invite link have their row restored (removedAt reset) rather than a new row created
  - `addMember` (email path): checks `removedAt` before throwing 409; restores previously removed members instead of erroring

---

## 2026-05-25 (61) — Phase 3: Events module — DELETE /events/:id/members/:memberId

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `removeMember(eventId, callerId, memberId)` — 404 if event not found/deleted; 403 if caller is not the organizer; 404 if the target member row doesn't exist in this event; 400 if target has `role: ORGANIZER` (organizer cannot be removed); 409 if the member has any financial history (`paidExpenses`, `expenseSplits`, `sentSettlements`, or `receivedSettlements` counts > 0). On success, hard-deletes the `EventMember` row. Returns void; controller sends 204.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `DELETE /events/:id/members/:memberId` handler returning 204 No Content.

---

## 2026-05-25 (60) — Phase 3: Events module — POST /events/:id/members

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/events/dto/add-member.dto.ts`: `AddMemberDto` with optional `email` (validated as email format) and `name` (max 100 chars, required via `@ValidateIf` when `email` is absent). Service also guards against both fields being missing.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `addMember(eventId, callerId, dto)` — 404 if event not found/deleted; 403 if caller is not the organizer; 400 if event is ARCHIVED. **Email path**: looks up user by email (404 if not found), checks for existing membership (409 if duplicate), creates `EventMember` with the user's id and name. **Guest path**: creates `EventMember` with `userId: null` and the provided `name` as nickname; multiple guests allowed because PostgreSQL's unique constraint treats NULL ≠ NULL.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `POST /events/:id/members` handler returning 201 Created.

## 2026-05-25 (59) — Phase 3: Events module — POST /events/:id/join

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/events/dto/join-event.dto.ts`: `JoinEventDto` with a required `token` string field (`@IsString @IsNotEmpty`).

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `joinEvent(eventId, userId, dto)` — fetches event by id (404 if not found or deleted); 400 if event is ARCHIVED; 400 if provided token doesn't match `event.inviteToken`; 409 if user already has a member row for this event. On success, looks up the user's name and creates an `EventMember` row with role `MEMBER`. Returns the new member record.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `POST /events/:id/join` handler returning 201 Created.

---

## 2026-05-25 (58) — Phase 3: Events module — GET /events/:id/invite

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `getInvite(eventId, userId)` — fetches `inviteToken` and checks if the caller has a member row in the event in a single query (404 if not found/deleted; 403 if caller is not a member). Returns `{ inviteToken, inviteUrl }` where `inviteUrl` is constructed from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` env var (falls back to `http://localhost:3000`).
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `GET /events/:id/invite` handler returning 200. Placed before `GET /events/:id` in the route list to prevent `:id` from swallowing the `invite` segment.

---

## 2026-05-25 (57) — Phase 3: Events module — DELETE /events/:id

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `deleteEvent(eventId, userId)` — fetches `organizerId` (404 if not found or already deleted); throws 403 if caller is not the organizer; sets `deletedAt = now()` and `status = ARCHIVED` (soft delete). Returns void; controller sends 204.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `DELETE /events/:id` handler returning 204 No Content.

---

## 2026-05-25 (56) — Phase 3: Events module — PATCH /events/:id

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/events/dto/update-event.dto.ts`: All fields optional — `name` (`@MinLength(1) @MaxLength(100)`), `type` (`@IsEnum(EventType)`), `description` (`@MaxLength(500)`), `coverImageUrl` (`@IsUrl`).

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `updateEvent(eventId, userId, dto)` — fetches `organizerId` (404 if not found or deleted); throws 403 if caller is not the organizer; patches only the fields present in the DTO using conditional spread.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `PATCH /events/:id` handler returning 200.

---

## 2026-05-25 (55) — Phase 3: Events module — GET /events/:id

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `getEventDetail(eventId, userId)` — fetches the event by ID where `deletedAt` is null (404 if not found); includes `members` ordered by role then join date; throws 403 if the caller is not in the members list.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `GET /events/:id` handler returning 200.

---

## 2026-05-25 (54) — Phase 3: Events module — GET /events

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: Added `EVENT_LIST_SELECT` constant (id, name, description, type, status, coverImageUrl, organizerId, createdAt, updatedAt, `_count.members`). Added `getEvents(userId)` — queries events where `deletedAt` is null and the user is a member (`members.some({ userId })`), ordered by `createdAt desc`.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: Added `GET /events` handler returning 200, delegating to `eventsService.getEvents`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (53) — Phase 3: Events module — POST /events

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/events/dto/create-event.dto.ts`: `CreateEventDto` with `name` (`@IsString @IsNotEmpty @MaxLength(100)`), optional `type` (`@IsEnum(EventType)`), optional `description` (`@IsString @MaxLength(500)`), and optional `coverImageUrl` (`@IsUrl`).
- `apps/api/src/events/events.service.ts`: `EventsService` with `createEvent(userId, dto)` — fetches the user's `name` from DB (throws 404 if not found), then runs a `$transaction` that (1) creates the `Event` row with `organizerId` set to the caller and (2) creates an `EventMember` row linking the user as `ORGANIZER`. Returns the event object with the `members` array.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.controller.ts`: `EventsController` at path `events`. `POST /events` is protected by the global `JwtAuthGuard`, uses `@CurrentUser()` to extract the user ID, returns 201.
- `apps/api/src/events/events.module.ts`: NestJS module wiring `EventsController` and `EventsService`.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: Added `EventsModule` to the `imports` array.

---

## 2026-05-25 (52) — Phase 3: Users module — GET /users/me + PATCH /users/me

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/src/users/dto/update-profile.dto.ts`: `UpdateProfileDto` with optional `name` (`@IsString @MinLength(1) @MaxLength(100)`) and `avatarUrl` (`@IsUrl`) fields. Both are fully optional so callers can patch just one field at a time.
- `apps/api/src/users/users.service.ts`: `UsersService` with two methods:
  - `getMe(userId)` — fetches `id`, `email`, `name`, `avatarUrl`, `role`, `emailVerified`, `createdAt` for the authenticated user; throws 404 if the user no longer exists.
  - `updateMe(userId, dto)` — verifies the user exists (404 if not), then updates only the fields present in the DTO using conditional spread to avoid overwriting unset fields with `undefined`; returns the same safe field set.
- `apps/api/src/users/users.controller.ts`: `UsersController` at path `users`, protected by the global `JwtAuthGuard`. Uses `@CurrentUser()` to extract the JWT payload (`sub` = user ID) for both handlers.
  - `GET /users/me` → delegates to `usersService.getMe`.
  - `PATCH /users/me` → delegates to `usersService.updateMe`.
- `apps/api/src/users/users.module.ts`: NestJS module wiring `UsersController` and `UsersService`. `PrismaModule` is global so no explicit import needed.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: Added `UsersModule` to the `imports` array.

---

## 2026-05-25 (51) — Phase 3: Auth — Integration tests with Supertest + Neon DB (M10)

**Files added:**
- `apps/api/test/auth.e2e-spec.ts`: 33 integration tests across 7 describe blocks covering all auth endpoints. Runs against the `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` (Neon PostgreSQL — no Docker needed). Isolation: every email is prefixed with a unique per-run stamp (`e2e-<timestamp>-`); stale rows from prior runs are deleted in `beforeAll`, and all rows created in this run are deleted in `afterAll`. `ThrottlerGuard.prototype.canActivate` is spied on before module compilation to prevent 429s during rapid test execution.
  - `POST /auth/register` (7 cases): happy path, DB persistence, duplicate email, missing/empty name, invalid email, short password.
  - `POST /auth/login` (6 cases): HttpOnly cookies on success, safe body, wrong password, unknown email, unverified email, inactive user.
  - `POST /auth/refresh` (3 cases): valid token → new cookies, no cookie → 401, token absent from DB → 401.
  - `POST /auth/logout` (3 cases): cookies cleared, ok without cookie, refresh token deleted from DB.
  - `POST /auth/verify-email` (5 cases): marks verified + clears token, idempotent for already-verified, unknown token, expired token, user can log in after verification.
  - `POST /auth/forgot-password` (4 cases): always ok (enumeration-safe), reset token persisted for verified user, no token for unverified user, missing field → 400.
  - `POST /auth/reset-password` (5 cases): password changed (old rejected, new accepted), unknown token, expired token, short password, token is single-use.
- `apps/api/test/jest-e2e.json`: Jest config for e2e suite (`tsconfig.e2e.json`, `test/*.e2e-spec.ts`, 120 s timeout).
- `apps/api/tsconfig.e2e.json`: TypeScript config extending the base with `esModuleInterop: true` and `include: ["src/**/*", "test/**/*"]`.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/package.json`: Added `test:e2e` script; added `supertest` + `@types/supertest` devDependencies.
- `apps/api/tsconfig.json`: Added `test/**/*` to `include` so IDE diagnostics work for e2e files (production build still excluded via `tsconfig.build.json`).

---

## 2026-05-25 (50) — Phase 3: Auth — Unit test gaps closed (M5, M6)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added 3 missing unit tests to the `refresh` describe block:
  - `throws 401 when refresh token is expired (correct secret, exp in past)` (M5) — signs a JWT with `exp` set 60 s in the past; `verify()` throws `TokenExpiredError`, caught and rethrown as 401.
  - `throws 401 when user is inactive` (M6) — valid token, user returned with `isActive: false`; guard rejects before reaching the refreshToken DB check.
  - `throws 401 when user email is not verified` (M6) — valid token, user returned with `emailVerified: false`; same guard path.
- Total tests: 32 → 35, all passing.

**Also:** Marked M4, M5, M6, and M9 as `[x]` in `specs/implementation-plan.md` — M4 was already covered by the F1 test, M9 was done in entry 49 but the checkbox was not updated.

---

## 2026-05-25 (49) — Phase 3: Auth — Stricter rate limiting on login & forgot-password (M9)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: Added `ThrottlerGuard` as the first `APP_GUARD` (applied before JWT and role guards). Named the existing throttler `'default'` to support per-endpoint overrides. Global limit remains 60 req/min per IP.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Imported `Throttle` from `@nestjs/throttler`. Added `@Throttle({ default: { ttl: 60_000, limit: 5 } })` to `POST /auth/login` and `POST /auth/forgot-password`, overriding the global default to 5 req/min for those two endpoints only.

**Note:** The `ThrottlerGuard` was not previously registered as a global guard, so the 60 req/min bucket was defined but never enforced. This change activates global rate limiting for the first time.

---

## 2026-05-25 (48) — Phase 3: Auth — Refresh token rotation with DB invalidation (M3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: Added `RefreshToken` model (`id`, `userId`, `tokenHash` (unique), `expiresAt`, `createdAt`) with a cascade-delete relation to `User` and an index on `userId`.
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260525_add_refresh_token_table/migration.sql`: Migration SQL creating the `refresh_tokens` table, unique index on `tokenHash`, and FK to `users` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`:
  - Added `hashToken(token)` — SHA-256 hex digest of the raw JWT (deterministic, fast, no salt needed for lookup).
  - Added `storeRefreshToken(userId, token)` — hashes and persists the token with a 7-day expiry.
  - Added `rotateRefreshToken(oldToken, userId, newToken)` — atomically deletes the old hash and inserts the new one in a `$transaction`.
  - `login()`: calls `storeRefreshToken()` after issuing tokens.
  - `googleLogin()`: calls `storeRefreshToken()` after issuing tokens.
  - `refresh()`: validates the incoming token against the DB; throws 401 if not found or expired; calls `rotateRefreshToken()` to blacklist old and register new token atomically.
  - `logout()`: now accepts `req`, extracts the refresh token cookie, and calls `deleteMany` on its hash before clearing cookies.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: `logout` handler updated to inject `@Req()` and pass it to `authService.logout(req, res)`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Updated `mockPrisma` to include `refreshToken` (create/findUnique/delete/deleteMany) and `$transaction`. Fixed `logout` test (now async, passes mock `req`). Added second logout test for missing cookie. Updated `refresh` happy-path test to mock `refreshToken.findUnique/delete/create`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (47b) — Phase 3: Auth — resendVerification unit tests

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `describe('resendVerification')` block with 4 unit tests matching the pattern used for `forgotPassword`: happy path (token generated, 24 h expiry verified), unknown email, inactive user, and already-verified user — all silent `{ ok: true }` without touching DB. Suite grows from 27 → 31 tests, all passing.

---

## 2026-05-25 (47) — Phase 3: Auth — POST /auth/resend-verification (M2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/resend-verification.dto.ts`: New DTO with `@IsEmail()` on the `email` field.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `resendVerification(dto)`. Looks up user by email; silently returns `{ ok: true }` if the user doesn't exist, is inactive, or is already verified (enumeration-safe). Otherwise generates a fresh UUID token with a 24 h expiry, updates the DB, and calls `sendVerificationEmail()`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/resend-verification` (public, `200 OK`), delegating to `authService.resendVerification()`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (46) — Phase 3: Auth — Google OAuth login via Passport (M1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: Added `googleId String? @unique` to the `User` model.
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260525_add_google_id_to_users/migration.sql`: Migration SQL for the new column and unique index.
- `apps/api/src/auth/strategies/google.strategy.ts`: New `GoogleStrategy` extending `PassportStrategy(Strategy, 'google')`. Reads `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from env. Extracts `googleId`, `email`, `name`, and `avatarUrl` from the Google profile and passes them as a typed `GoogleProfile` object.
- `apps/api/src/auth/guards/google-auth.guard.ts`: New `GoogleAuthGuard` extending `AuthGuard('google')`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `googleLogin(profile, res)`. Looks up user by `googleId` OR `email` (handles account linking). Creates a new user if none exists (`emailVerified: true` since Google already verified it). Updates existing email-only account to set `googleId`. Rejects inactive accounts. Issues JWT pair via HttpOnly cookies and returns the user profile.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `GET /auth/google` (redirect to Google) and `GET /auth/google/callback` (receives profile, calls `googleLogin`, redirects to `/dashboard` on success or `/login?error=oauth_failed` on failure).
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`: Imported `PassportModule` and registered `GoogleStrategy` as a provider.
- `apps/api/package.json`: Added `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, `passport-google-oauth20` (runtime) and `@types/passport`, `@types/passport-google-oauth20` (dev).

---

## 2026-05-25 (45) — Phase 3: Auth QA fix — RegisterDto rejects empty name (M7)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`: Added `@IsNotEmpty()` decorator to the `name` field (alongside the existing `@IsString()`). Previously, `name: ""` passed validation and was written to the database. The global `ValidationPipe` enforces the constraint at the HTTP boundary, so no service changes were needed.

---

## 2026-05-25 (44) — Phase 3: Auth QA fix — forgotPassword() skips unverified accounts (M11)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `emailVerified` to the `select` in `forgotPassword()`. Extended the early-return guard from `!user || !user.isActive` to also include `!user.emailVerified`. Unverified accounts now silently receive `{ ok: true }` without generating a token or sending an email — consistent with the enumeration-safe pattern already used for unknown/inactive users.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `emailVerified: true` to the `activeUser` fixture (required now that the field is selected). Added one new test: `emailVerified: false` → returns `{ ok: true }`, `update` not called. Total tests: 27, all passing.

Also ran `prisma generate` to resolve stale client errors on `passwordResetExpiry` that surfaced during typecheck.

---

## 2026-05-25 (43) — Phase 3: Auth QA fix — GET /auth/health returns 503 when degraded (F3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Replaced the static `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)` on the `health` endpoint with dynamic status code logic. The controller now awaits `authService.health()` and calls `res.status(503)` before returning the body when `result.status === 'degraded'`. Previously the endpoint always returned 200 regardless of DB or JWT config failures, preventing load balancers from detecting the degraded state.

---

## 2026-05-25 (42) — Test fix: auth.service.spec.ts updated for F1 + F2

**Issue:** After F1 and F2 changes, the test suite had 1 failure and 2 missing cases.

**Failures fixed:**
- `resetPassword` happy-path mock was missing `isActive: true` — the new guard caused it to throw 400. Fixed all `resetPassword` mocks to include `isActive`.

**Missing tests added:**
- `login()` with `isActive: false` → 401 and bcrypt **not called** (verifies F1 skips bcrypt for inactive accounts).
- `resetPassword()` with `isActive: false` → 400 and `update` not called (verifies F2 blocks deactivated users).

**Result:** 26 tests, all passing.

---

## 2026-05-25 (41) — Phase 3: Auth QA fix — resetPassword() checks isActive (F2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `isActive` to the `select` in `resetPassword()`. Combined the existence + active check into a single guard: `if (!user || !user.isActive)` returns the generic 400 "Liên kết đặt lại mật khẩu không hợp lệ". Previously, a deactivated user could still consume a valid reset token issued before deactivation and regain account access within the 1h TTL window.
- Ran `npx prisma generate` to resolve a stale Prisma client that did not expose `passwordResetExpiry` in `UserSelect`.

---

## 2026-05-25 (40) — Phase 3: Auth QA fix — login() checks isActive before bcrypt (F1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Reordered `login()` checks. `isActive` is now verified **before** `bcrypt.compare`. If the user does not exist or is inactive, the method immediately throws the same generic `UnauthorizedException('Email hoặc mật khẩu không đúng')` without running bcrypt. Previously, a caller who supplied the correct password for a deactivated account received the distinct error "Tài khoản đã bị vô hiệu hoá" — leaking both account existence and password correctness. The new order: (1) find user, (2) check `isActive`, (3) bcrypt compare, (4) check `emailVerified`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (39) — Phase 3: Auth module — GET /auth/health

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `health()` — runs `SELECT 1` against the DB via Prisma and checks that both `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` env vars are set; returns `{ status, checks: { database, jwtConfig }, timestamp }`. Status is `"ok"` when both checks pass, `"degraded"` otherwise.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `GET /auth/health` handler; decorated with `@Get('health') @HttpCode(200)`. Inherits `@Public()` from the class so no JWT is required.

Also regenerated the Prisma client (`npx prisma generate`) to fix pre-existing type errors where `passwordResetToken` / `passwordResetExpiry` were missing from the generated types.

---

## 2026-05-24 (38) — Phase 3: Auth module — JWT auth guard + role guard

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/types/jwt-payload.interface.ts` *(new)*: `JwtPayload` interface `{ sub, email, role: UserRole }` shared by guards and decorators.
- `apps/api/src/auth/decorators/public.decorator.ts` *(new)*: `@Public()` metadata decorator; sets `IS_PUBLIC_KEY` so `JwtAuthGuard` skips the route.
- `apps/api/src/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.ts` *(new)*: `@Roles(...UserRole[])` metadata decorator; sets `ROLES_KEY` consumed by `RolesGuard`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/decorators/current-user.decorator.ts` *(new)*: `@CurrentUser()` param decorator; extracts `request.user: JwtPayload` for use in controller methods.
- `apps/api/src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts` *(new)*: `JwtAuthGuard` — reads `access_token` HttpOnly cookie, skips if `@Public()`, validates JWT with `JWT_SECRET`, attaches payload to `request.user`; throws 401 if missing or expired.
- `apps/api/src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts` *(new)*: `RolesGuard` — reads `@Roles()` metadata; if present, checks `request.user.role` is in the allowed list; throws 403 otherwise.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`: Exports `JwtAuthGuard`, `RolesGuard`, and `JwtModule` so other modules can inject them.
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: Registers `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard` as global `APP_GUARD` providers, protecting all routes by default.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `@Public()` at class level so all auth endpoints remain accessible without a token.
- `apps/api/src/health/health.controller.ts`: Added `@Public()` at class level for the health-check endpoint.

**Behaviour:**
- Every route requires a valid `access_token` cookie unless decorated with `@Public()`.
- `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)` on a controller/handler restricts access to ADMIN users; non-admin callers receive 403.
- Event-level ORGANIZER/MEMBER authorization will be added per-handler in the events/expenses modules using the same `@CurrentUser()` + service-level checks pattern.

---

## 2026-05-24 (37) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/reset-password

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/reset-password.dto.ts` *(new)*: `ResetPasswordDto` with `token` (`@IsString @IsNotEmpty`) and `password` (`@MinLength(8)`) fields.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `resetPassword()` — looks up user by `passwordResetToken` (unique index); throws 400 if not found; throws 400 if `passwordResetExpiry` is null or in the past; hashes the new password with bcrypt (12 rounds); updates user with new `passwordHash` and nulls out both reset token fields; returns `{ ok: true }`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/reset-password` route using `@Body() ResetPasswordDto`, returns 200.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `resetPassword` describe block with 4 cases: valid token → password hashed and token cleared; unknown token → 400; expired token → 400; null expiry → 400.

All 24 auth service tests pass. Ran `npx prisma generate` to ensure Prisma client reflects `passwordResetToken @unique` in `UserWhereUniqueInput`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (36) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/forgot-password

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: Added `passwordResetToken String? @unique` and `passwordResetExpiry DateTime?` fields to `User` model.
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260524_add_password_reset_to_user/migration.sql` *(new)*: `ALTER TABLE "users"` adds `passwordResetToken` (unique, nullable) and `passwordResetExpiry` (nullable) columns.
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/forgot-password.dto.ts` *(new)*: `ForgotPasswordDto` with a single `email` field validated with `@IsEmail @IsNotEmpty`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `forgotPassword()` — looks up user by email; always returns `{ ok: true }` (prevents user enumeration); skips DB write when user is not found or inactive; otherwise generates a UUID reset token with 1-hour TTL, persists it via `prisma.user.update`, and calls `sendPasswordResetEmail()`. Added private `sendPasswordResetEmail()` — logs reset URL in dev (no `RESEND_API_KEY`); sends a Vietnamese-language reset email via Resend in production with HTML-escaped name. Added `RESET_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS = 1` constant.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/forgot-password` route using `@Body() ForgotPasswordDto`, returns 200.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `forgotPassword` describe block with 3 cases: known active user → token persisted with ~1h expiry; unknown email → `{ ok: true }` without DB write; inactive user → `{ ok: true }` without DB write.

All 20 auth service tests pass. Ran `npx prisma generate` to update the client.

---

## 2026-05-24 (35b) — Review fix: POST /auth/verify-email

**Issue found and fixed:**
- **Missing test for null `verificationTokenExpiry`** — the `!user.verificationTokenExpiry` branch in `verifyEmail()` (handles users created without an expiry, e.g. via direct DB insert) had no test. Added case "throws 400 when verificationTokenExpiry is null" to `auth.service.spec.ts`.

All 17 auth service tests pass.

---

## 2026-05-24 (35) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/verify-email

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `verifyEmail(token)` — looks up user by `verificationToken` (unique index); throws 400 if not found; returns `{ ok: true }` immediately if already verified (idempotent); throws 400 if `verificationTokenExpiry` is in the past; otherwise sets `emailVerified = true` and nulls out both token fields.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/verify-email` route using `@Body() VerifyEmailDto`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/verify-email.dto.ts` *(new)*: `VerifyEmailDto` with a single `token` field (`@IsString @IsNotEmpty`).
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `verifyEmail` describe block with 4 cases: valid token → user updated; already verified → returns ok without update; unknown token → 400; expired token → 400. Also added `update: jest.fn()` to `mockPrisma.user`.

All 16 auth service tests pass.

**Also:** Ran `npx prisma generate` to regenerate the Prisma client — `verificationToken` and `verificationTokenExpiry` fields were in `schema.prisma` but the generated client was stale.

---

## 2026-05-24 (34b) — Review fix: POST /auth/logout

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Missing unit test** — test plan targets 90% auth service coverage and explicitly lists `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` in the integration test suite. No test existed. Fixed: added `logout` describe block in `auth.service.spec.ts` that asserts `clearCookie` is called for both `access_token` and `refresh_token` with `httpOnly: true, path: '/'` options, and that the return value is `{ ok: true }`.
2. **`makeMockResponse` lacked `clearCookie` mock** — calling `logout` would throw `TypeError: res.clearCookie is not a function` in existing test infrastructure. Fixed: added `clearCookie: jest.fn()` to the mock response factory.

All 12 auth service tests pass.

---

## 2026-05-24 (34) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/logout

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `logout()` — calls `res.clearCookie` for both `access_token` and `refresh_token` with the same cookie options used when setting them (`httpOnly`, `sameSite: lax`, `secure` in prod, `path: /`), then returns `{ ok: true }`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/logout` route; uses `@Res({ passthrough: true })` to write cookie-clearing headers while NestJS handles serialisation normally.

---

## 2026-05-24 (33) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/refresh

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `refresh()` — reads `refresh_token` HttpOnly cookie, verifies with `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, checks user still exists/active/verified, issues a rotated access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days) as new HttpOnly cookies. Extracted `setTokenCookies()` helper shared with `login()`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/refresh` route using `@Req()` + `@Res({ passthrough: true })`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`: Added `refresh` describe block with 4 unit tests: valid token → new cookies issued; no cookie → 401; wrong secret → 401; user not found → 401. Uses `beforeAll`/`afterAll` to set JWT env secrets for the test scope.

---

## 2026-05-24 (32b) — Review fix: POST /auth/login

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Missing `emailVerified` check** — product spec requires "Unverified email accounts cannot access the app". Added guard in `login()` that throws 401 before issuing tokens if `emailVerified` is false.
2. **Missing unit tests for login** — test plan requires `Login with correct credentials`, `Login with wrong password`, and by extension unverified/missing user cases. Added a `login` describe block in `auth.service.spec.ts` with 4 cases covering all paths.
3. **IDE couldn't resolve jest globals in spec files** — `tsconfig.json` excluded `**/*.spec.ts`, so the language server never loaded `@types/jest`. Fixed by removing spec files from `tsconfig.json`'s exclude (build still uses `tsconfig.build.json` which keeps them excluded) and adding `"types": ["jest", "node"]`. Also added `tsconfig.spec.json` pointed at by the jest `transform` config.

All 7 tests pass.

---

## 2026-05-24 (32) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/login

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/login.dto.ts` *(new)*: `LoginDto` with `email` + `password` fields validated via `class-validator`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: Added `login()` — looks up user by email, bcrypt-compares password (constant-time; same error for wrong email and wrong password to prevent user enumeration), checks `isActive`, signs access token (15 min) and refresh token (7 days) with separate secrets, sets both as `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Secure in prod` cookies, returns safe user fields.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: Added `POST /auth/login` using `@Res({ passthrough: true })` to let NestJS still handle serialisation while the service writes cookies directly.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`: Imported `JwtModule.register({})` (secrets passed per-call so no global secret needed).
- `apps/api/src/main.ts`: Registered `cookie-parser` middleware.
- `apps/api/package.json`: Added `@nestjs/jwt`, `cookie-parser`, `@types/cookie-parser`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (31b) — Review fix: POST /auth/register

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **HTML injection in verification email** — `name` was interpolated raw into the HTML email body. A user with a name containing `<`, `>`, or `&` would break email rendering; a crafted name could inject arbitrary HTML. Fixed: added `escapeHtml()` helper in `auth.service.ts` that escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`; used it when building the email `html` string.
2. **Missing unit tests** — test plan requires AuthService unit tests at 90% coverage with specific cases. Fixed: created `src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts` covering all three test plan cases: (a) valid registration → user created with hashed password and safe fields returned; (b) duplicate email → 409 ConflictException; (c) verification token stored with a 24h future expiry. All 3 tests pass.
3. **Missing `@nestjs/testing`** — dev dependency required by Jest test module; added to `apps/api/package.json`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (31) — Phase 3: Auth module — POST /auth/register

**Files created:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`: NestJS module wiring `AuthController` and `AuthService`.
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`: `POST /api/v1/auth/register` — returns 201 with safe user fields (no password hash).
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts`: `register()` — checks email uniqueness (409 on conflict), hashes password with bcrypt (12 rounds), generates a UUID verification token (24h TTL), writes the user to DB, then sends a verification email. If `RESEND_API_KEY` is set, sends via Resend; otherwise logs the verification URL.
- `apps/api/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`: `RegisterDto` — `name` (string), `email` (valid email), `password` (min 8 chars) validated with `class-validator`.
- `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260524_add_verification_token_to_user/migration.sql`: adds `verificationToken` (unique, nullable) and `verificationTokenExpiry` (nullable DateTime) columns to `users` table.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: added `verificationToken String? @unique` and `verificationTokenExpiry DateTime?` fields to `User` model.
- `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`: imported `AuthModule`.
- `apps/api/package.json`: added `bcrypt`, `@types/bcrypt`, and `resend` dependencies.

---

## 2026-05-24 (30) — Phase 2: Shared components — Status badge component

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/status-badge.tsx`: `StatusBadge` component. Accepts `status: AppStatus` (`'ACTIVE' | 'SETTLED' | 'ARCHIVED' | 'PENDING' | 'CONFIRMED' | 'INACTIVE'`) and optional `className`. Each status maps to a Vietnamese label, a Badge variant, and an optional Lucide icon: ACTIVE → "Đang diễn ra" (success); SETTLED → "Đã huề" (outline); ARCHIVED → "Đã lưu trữ" (secondary); PENDING → "Chờ xác nhận" (warning, Clock icon); CONFIRMED → "Đã xác nhận" (success, CheckCircle2 icon); INACTIVE → "Đã vô hiệu" (destructive).

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/settlements/page.tsx`: removed inline `StatusBadge` function and unused `SettlementStatus` type; changed `Settlement.status` to `AppStatus`; replaced imports.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: removed `STATUS_LABELS` and `STATUS_VARIANTS` maps; replaced inline `<Badge variant={STATUS_VARIANTS[…]}>…</Badge>` with `<StatusBadge status={event.status} />`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`: removed `EVENT_STATUS_LABELS` and `EVENT_STATUS_VARIANTS` maps; replaced event status Badge with `<StatusBadge status={event.status} />`. User ACTIVE/INACTIVE kept as inline Badge (different label "Hoạt động" and `outline` variant vs event ACTIVE semantics).

---

## 2026-05-24 (29) — Phase 2: Shared components — Currency display component

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/currency.tsx`: `CurrencyDisplay` component. Props: `amount` (integer VND value), `className` (optional). Formats the integer using `toLocaleString('vi-VN')` (produces dot-separated thousands, e.g. "150.000") and appends " ₫". Always renders with `tabular-nums` so columns of amounts stay aligned.

---

## 2026-05-24 (28b) — Review fix: Avatar component

**Issues found and fixed in `apps/web/components/ui/avatar.tsx`:**
1. **Runtime error on external `src` URLs** — used `next/image` which requires `remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` for Cloudinary URLs; any external avatar URL would throw at runtime. Fixed: switched to a plain `<img>` tag with an `eslint-disable` comment explaining the intent. This avoids domain config requirements while keeping the photo path working for all URL origins.
2. **WCAG 2.1 AA — missing accessible label on initials** — spec §8 requires WCAG 2.1 AA for core flows; the initials `<div>` rendered as unlabelled presentational text. Fixed: added `role="img"` and `aria-label={name}` so screen readers announce the person's name instead of raw initials.

---

## 2026-05-24 (28) — Phase 2: Shared components — Avatar component

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/avatar.tsx`: `Avatar` component. Props: `name` (required — used for initials and `alt`), `src` (optional image URL), `size` (`'sm'` 28 px / `'md'` 32 px / `'lg'` 36 px, default `'md'`), `className`. Initials logic: single-word names → first letter; multi-word names → first + last word initials (e.g. "Minh Anh" → "MA"). When `src` is provided, renders a Next.js `<Image>` inside the circle. Falls back to initials when `src` is absent.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/balances/page.tsx`: replaced inline `h-8 w-8` avatar div with `<Avatar name={member.name} size="md" />`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/members/page.tsx`: replaced inline `h-9 w-9` avatar div with `<Avatar name={member.name} size="lg" />`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/chat/page.tsx`: replaced inline `h-7 w-7` avatar div (with conditional `invisible` class) with `<Avatar name={msg.sender} size="sm" className={cn('mt-0.5', !showSender && 'invisible')} />`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (27) — Phase 2: Shared components — Empty state component

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`: reusable `EmptyState` component. Props: `icon` (Lucide `React.ElementType`), `title` (required string), `description` (optional string), `bordered` (boolean — adds `rounded-xl border border-dashed` wrapper, used on dashboard), `className` (escape hatch for padding/height overrides), `children` (action slot for CTA buttons).

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: replaced inline dashed-border empty state with `<EmptyState icon={MapPin} bordered …>`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/expenses/page.tsx`: replaced inline empty state with `<EmptyState icon={Receipt} …>`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/settlements/page.tsx`: replaced inline empty state with `<EmptyState icon={Handshake} …>`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/chat/page.tsx`: replaced inline empty state with `<EmptyState icon={MessageCircle} className="h-full py-0" />`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (26) — Phase 2: Shared components — Loading skeleton

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`: base `Skeleton` primitive — a `<div>` with `animate-pulse bg-muted rounded-md` and an optional `className` prop. Follows the shadcn/ui pattern.
- `apps/web/components/ui/skeletons.tsx`: composed page-level skeleton components for all data-heavy pages:
  - `EventCardsSkeleton` — grid of event card placeholders (count prop, default 3)
  - `ExpenseListSkeleton` — list rows with description + badge + meta + amount (rows prop, default 4)
  - `BalanceSkeleton` — net-position rows with avatar circles + simplified transaction rows (memberCount prop)
  - `SettlementListSkeleton` — settlement rows with status badge placeholder (rows prop, default 3)
  - `ChatSkeleton` — alternating incoming/outgoing chat bubble placeholders + pinned input bar
  - `AdminStatsSkeleton` — three stat card placeholders matching the admin layout
  - `AdminTableSkeleton` — full `<table>` with thead and tbody rows (rows + cols props, defaults 5/4); first column gets stacked double-line, last column gets a right-aligned button placeholder

---

## 2026-05-24 (25) — Phase 2: Admin dashboard — Event table

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`: added **Sự kiện** section below the user table. Table columns: event name + organizer (stacked), status badge (**Đang diễn ra** green / **Đã huề** outline / **Đã lưu trữ** secondary), member count, and an **"Lưu trữ"** action button. Archive button is hidden on already-ARCHIVED rows; clicking it sets the event's status to `ARCHIVED` in local state. Mock seed: 5 events (3 ACTIVE, 1 SETTLED, 1 pre-ARCHIVED).

---

## 2026-05-24 (24) — Phase 2: Admin dashboard — User table

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`: converted from server to client component (needed for Deactivate toggle). Added a **Người dùng** section below the stats cards with a full-width `<table>` showing: name + email (stacked), role badge (**Quản trị** / **Người dùng**), status badge (**Hoạt động** in outline / **Đã vô hiệu** in destructive red), formatted registration date (dd/mm/yyyy), and an action button. **Deactivate/Activate button** toggling `ACTIVE ↔ INACTIVE` in local state; hidden for ADMIN-role users to prevent self-lockout. Mock seed: 6 users (1 admin + 5 regular, one pre-set to INACTIVE).

---

## 2026-05-24 (23) — Phase 2: Admin dashboard — Stats cards

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`: admin overview page with three stat cards — **Tổng người dùng** (128, with +12 in last 30 days note), **Tổng sự kiện** (47, broken down into active/settled), **Tổng VNĐ theo dõi** (12.450.000 ₫, across all events). Each card uses a two-row layout: icon + label row, then large bold value + description row. Static/mock data (replaced by API in Phase 4). Server component.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/layout.tsx`: added "Quản trị" nav link pointing to `/admin` so the page is reachable from the app shell.

---

## 2026-05-24 (22) — Phase 2: Invite link display with Copy button

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/members/page.tsx`: added an invite link card above the member list. A `useEffect` sets `inviteUrl` to `window.location.origin + /join/<token>` after mount (avoiding SSR mismatch; shows `…` placeholder during hydration). Mock tokens keyed by event ID (`inv_1a2b3c4d5e6f` for event 1, `inv_9z8y7x6w5v4u` for event 2). Copy button calls `navigator.clipboard.writeText`; on success flips the icon to a green Check and label to "Đã sao chép" for 2 seconds, then resets.

---

## 2026-05-24 (21) — Phase 2: Members tab

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/members/page.tsx`: replaced stub with a full stateful client component. Each row shows an avatar initial bubble, member name (with "(bạn)" suffix for the current user), a role badge (Ban tổ chức / Thành viên / Khách), and the member's email when available. Role badge uses `default` variant for organizer, `secondary` for member, `outline` for guest. **Remove button**: shown only when the current user is the organizer, only on non-organizer members, and never on the current user's own row. Clicking opens a confirmation `Dialog` explaining that the member's existing expenses are preserved. Confirming filters the member from local state. Seed data for events `1` (6 members: 1 organizer, 3 members, 2 guests) and `2` (7 members).

---

## 2026-05-24 (20) — Phase 2: Chat tab

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/chat/page.tsx`: replaced stub with a full stateful client component. Layout: a bordered container occupying remaining viewport height (`calc(100vh - 22rem)`), split into a scrollable message area (flex-1) and a pinned input bar at the bottom. **Message list**: messages ordered chronologically with date-separator dividers between days. Others' messages appear on the left with an avatar initial bubble (hidden when consecutive messages from the same sender); the simulated current user's messages appear right-aligned in a dark bubble. Consecutive messages from the same sender share the avatar slot (hidden but space preserved for alignment). **Auto-scroll**: jumps to the bottom instantly on mount; smooth-scrolls on each new message. **Send**: Enter key or Send icon button appends the message with the current timestamp; button disabled when input is empty. **Empty state**: centered MessageCircle icon with Vietnamese prompt. Seed data for events `1` (7 messages across 2 days) and `2` (4 messages).

---

## 2026-05-24 (19) — Phase 2: Record Settlement form

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/features/record-settlement-dialog.tsx`: Dialog for recording a new settlement. Fields: **Người trả** — pill selector for the payer; **Trả cho** — pill selector for the recipient (inline error if payer = recipient); **Số tiền** — VND integer input with formatted preview; **Hình thức thanh toán** — pill toggle: MoMo / VNPay / Tiền mặt / Khác; **Proof upload** — dashed drop zone for JPG/PNG/HEIC ≤ 5 MB with filename display and remove button. Submit button disabled until all required fields are valid.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/settlements/page.tsx`: converted to a stateful client component. Added "Ghi nhận thanh toán" button (in header row when settlements exist, and in empty-state CTA). Wired `RecordSettlementDialog`; new settlements are appended with status `PENDING`. Member lists added for events `1` and `2`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (18) — Phase 2: Settlements tab

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/settlements/page.tsx`: replaced stub with a full client component. Displays a list of settlements with PENDING / CONFIRMED status badges. Each row shows payer → recipient, status badge (yellow clock for PENDING, green checkmark for CONFIRMED), payment method (MoMo / VNPay / Tiền mặt / Khác), proof screenshot indicator, date, and amount. Summary line at the top shows total count and number confirmed. Empty state shows a Handshake icon with a message when there are no settlements. Static seed data for events `1` and `2`.

---

## 2026-05-24 (17) — Phase 2: Balances tab

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/balances/page.tsx`: replaced stub with a full client component. Runs the minimum-cash-flow balance algorithm against the same mock expense and member data used by the expenses tab. **Net positions section**: each member row shows an avatar initial, name, and their net balance (green + TrendingUp icon when owed money, red + TrendingDown when owing money, muted Minus when even). Amounts displayed rounded to the nearest 1,000 ₫. **"Ai cần trả ai" section**: simplified transaction list showing "X → Y: Z ₫" pairs — the minimum number of payments needed to settle the group. **All-settled empty state**: when all balances are zero, shows a PartyPopper icon and "Mọi người đã huề cả làng 🎉".

---

## 2026-05-24 (16) — Phase 2: Add Expense form

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/components/features/add-expense-dialog.tsx`: Dialog-based Add Expense form. Fields: description (required), amount (VND integer, formatted display below input), category (pill toggle: Ăn uống / Di chuyển / Lưu trú / Vui chơi / Khác), payer (pill toggle per member). Split mode via Tabs: **Chia đều** — member checkboxes with live per-person amount (remainder goes to first selected member, shown inline); **Tùy chỉnh** — per-member amount inputs with running total that turns red when it doesn't match the expense amount. Receipt photo upload: dashed-border drop zone, accepts JPG/PNG/HEIC up to 5 MB with size validation and filename display. Submit button disabled until form is valid.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/expenses/page.tsx`: converted static expense array to `useState` (seeded with mock data). "Thêm chi phí" buttons (header and empty state) now open the dialog. `handleAdd` appends new expenses to local state. Added `MOCK_MEMBERS` per event ID to supply to the dialog.

---

## 2026-05-24 (15) — Phase 2: Expenses tab

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/expenses/page.tsx`: replaced stub with a full client component. Shows a header row with expense count and total VND; a bordered, divided list of expenses where each row displays description, category chip (Ăn uống / Di chuyển / Lưu trú / Vui chơi / Khác), payer name, date, and amount (right-aligned, tabular numbers). "Thêm chi phí" button in the header. Empty state (Receipt icon + message + CTA) when no expenses exist. Static mock data keyed by event ID (replaced by API in Phase 4).

---

## 2026-05-24 (14) — Review fix: Event shell with tab navigation

**Issues found and fixed in `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/layout.tsx`:**
1. **WCAG 2.1 AA — missing `aria-label` on `nav`** — the page contains two `nav` elements (app header nav + tab nav); without a label, screen readers announce both as "navigation" with no way to distinguish them. Fixed: added `aria-label="Tab điều hướng sự kiện"` to the tab nav.
2. **WCAG 2.1 AA — missing `aria-current` on active tab** — SC 4.1.2 requires that the current state of a navigation item be conveyed to assistive technology. Fixed: added `aria-current="page"` to the active tab link, `undefined` (omitted) on inactive ones.

---

## 2026-05-24 (13) — Phase 2: Event shell with tab navigation

**Files created:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/layout.tsx`: client component — event header (name, description, member count, type + status badges) with a back link to the dashboard; link-based tab nav for Chi phí · Số dư · Thanh toán · Trò chuyện · Thành viên; active tab highlighted via `usePathname()`. Uses mock event data keyed by `[id]` (replaced by API in Phase 4).
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/page.tsx`: redirects to `/events/[id]/expenses`.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/expenses/page.tsx`: stub placeholder.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/balances/page.tsx`: stub placeholder.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/settlements/page.tsx`: stub placeholder.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/chat/page.tsx`: stub placeholder.
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/[id]/members/page.tsx`: stub placeholder.

---

## 2026-05-24 (12) — Review fix: Create event form

**Issues found and fixed in `apps/web/app/(app)/events/new/page.tsx`:**
1. **Memory leak** — `URL.createObjectURL` result was never revoked. Fixed: added `objectUrlRef` to track the active URL; revoked on image swap inside `handleFileChange`, on remove inside `removeCover`, and on component unmount via `useEffect` cleanup.
2. **`accept` attribute vs hint mismatch** — file input accepted `image/heic` but the visible hint said "JPG, PNG" only. HEIC files also cannot be rendered by browsers as `<img>` previews. Fixed: removed `image/heic` from `accept`; input now accepts `image/jpeg,image/png` only, consistent with the hint.
3. **"tối đa 5 MB" not enforced** — hint promised a 5 MB limit but no validation existed. Fixed: added `MAX_COVER_SIZE` constant and a size check in `handleFileChange`; files over 5 MB clear the input and show a `coverError` message in red below the upload zone.

---

## 2026-05-24 (11) — Phase 2: Create event form

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/events/new/page.tsx`: new client component — form with controlled state for name (text input, required), event type (3-option button toggle: Chuyến đi / Bữa ăn / Khác), description (textarea, optional), and cover photo (file input with live image preview + remove button). Submit button disabled until name is non-empty. Cancel link returns to `/dashboard`. No API call yet (wired in Phase 4).

---

## 2026-05-24 (10) — Phase 2: Dashboard empty state

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: added empty state branch — when `MOCK_EVENTS` is empty, renders a dashed-border panel with a MapPin icon, heading "Bạn chưa có chuyến đi nào", a short description, and a "Tạo chuyến đi đầu tiên" CTA button. The existing event grid renders when events are present.

---

## 2026-05-24 (9) — Phase 2: Event list page (dashboard)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: replaced placeholder with a grid of event cards. Each card shows event name, description, type badge (Chuyến đi / Bữa ăn / Khác), status badge (Đang diễn ra / Đã huề / Đã lưu trữ), member count, and date. "Tạo chuyến đi" button in the header. "Xem chi tiết" link per card. Static/hardcoded data (3 mock events). No API calls yet.

---

## 2026-05-24 (8) — Phase 2: Email sent confirmation screen

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(auth)/check-email/page.tsx`: created static email confirmation screen — envelope icon, "Kiểm tra email của bạn" heading, description prompting user to check inbox/spam, 15-minute expiry notice, "Gửi lại email" button linking back to forgot-password, link to login. Server component (no interactivity needed). Matches the auth layout pattern.

---

## 2026-05-24 (7) — Phase 2: Forgot password page

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`: created forgot password page — email input field, "Gửi liên kết đặt lại mật khẩu" submit button, link back to login. Client component matching the login/register pattern. No API calls yet.

---

## 2026-05-24 (6) — Phase 2: Register page

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`: replaced placeholder with full register form — name field, email field, password field, "Tạo tài khoản" button, Google OAuth button, link back to login page. Client component with controlled inputs. No API calls yet.

---

## 2026-05-24 (5) — Phase 2: Login page

**Files changed:**
- `apps/web/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`: replaced placeholder with full login form — email field, password field with "Quên mật khẩu?" link, Login button, Google OAuth button, link to register page. Client component with controlled inputs. No API calls yet.

**Fix — review against acceptance criteria:**
- Wrapped email/password fields and submit button in a `<form>` element so Enter key submits and password managers work correctly.
- Removed explicit `React.FormEvent` type annotation (deprecated in React 19); used inline `onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` instead.

---

## 2026-05-24 (4) — Phase 1: Project Setup complete

**Files created:**
- Root: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`
- `apps/web`: Next.js 15 scaffold with TailwindCSS v4, shadcn/ui base components (Button, Input, Card, Badge, Label, Separator, Tabs, Dialog, Toaster), route groups `(auth)` and `(app)`, placeholder pages
- `apps/api`: NestJS scaffold with global prefix `/api/v1`, helmet, compression, CORS, throttler, `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint, PrismaService (global module)
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: Full schema — User, Event, EventMember, Expense, ExpenseSplit, Settlement, Message with all enums
- `packages/shared`: Zod schemas for auth, events, expenses, settlements
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint + typecheck + test on push/PR

**Pending:** ~~Run `pnpm db:migrate` once `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env`.~~ ✓ Done.

---

## 2026-05-24 (3) — Implementation plan revision

- Rewrote `specs/implementation-plan.md` to v0.2: restructured phases from domain-slices into 7 build stages (Setup → UI → Backend → Connect → Validation → Local Run → ngrok Demo). Each phase now has granular checklist items.

---

## 2026-05-24 (2) — Spec revision

- Rewrote `specs/product-spec.md` to v0.2: added explicit App Goal, Target Users, Core User Flow diagram, per-feature Acceptance Criteria, and Out of Scope table. Data model condensed to summary table.

---

## 2026-05-24 — Phase 0

- Initialized project workspace at `/Users/mason/Workspace/masonnguyen/titra`.
- Created `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `specs/product-spec.md`, `specs/implementation-plan.md`, `specs/test-plan.md`.
- Decided on tech stack: Next.js 15 + NestJS + PostgreSQL (Neon) + Prisma.
- Defined MVP scope: auth, events, expenses, balances, settlements (link-based), email reminders, chat, PDF export, admin dashboard.
- Out of scope for MVP: native apps, direct payment API integration, SMS/Zalo/Messenger/Telegram reminders.
